/* Moonshine is a library for building interactive voice applications. It
   provides a high-level API for building voice interfaces, including
   voice-activity detection, diarization, transcription, speech understanding,
   and text-to-speech. It is designed to be fast, easy to use and to provide a
   high level of accuracy. It is also designed to be easy to integrate into your
   existing codebase across all major platforms.

   It uses the Moonshine family of speech to text models, which:

     - Understand multiple major languages, including English, Japanese,
       Korean, Chinese, Arabic, and more.

     - Are designed to be lightweight and fast for mobile and edge devices,
       and can be used in the cloud where latency and compute costs matter.

     - Support streaming transcription to reduce latency on real-time
       applications.

     - Are trained from scratch on a large, unique dataset of audio data,
       allowing our team to quickly train custom models for jargon or dialects.

     - Are available under permissive licenses, with English fully MIT
       licensed and other languages under a non-commercial agreement.

   You'll most likely want to use the specific bindings for your language of
   choice, since this is a low-level C API to the underlying implementation.
   This is the interface that those bindings all use though, so if you're
   interested in porting to a new environment or language, the inline notes
   here may be useful.

   Here's an example of how to use the transcriber:
   ```c
   #include "moonshine-c-api.h"

   int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
     int32_t transcriber_handle = moonshine_load_transcriber_from_files(
       "path/to/models", MOONSHINE_MODEL_ARCH_BASE, NULL, 0,
       MOONSHINE_HEADER_VERSION);
     if (transcriber_handle < 0) {
       fprintf(stderr, "Failed to load transcriber\n");
       return 1;
     }

     float audio_data[32000] = {};
     size_t audio_length = 32000;
     int32_t sample_rate = 16000;
     transcript_t *transcript = NULL;
     int32_t error = moonshine_transcribe_without_streaming(transcriber_handle,
   audio_data, audio_length, sample_rate, 0, &transcript); if (error != 0) {
       fprintf(stderr, "Failed to transcribe\n");
       return 1;
     }
     for (size_t i = 0; i < transcript->line_count; i++) {
       printf( "Line %zu at %f seconds: %s\n", i, transcript->lines[i].start,
         transcript->lines[i].text);
     }
     moonshine_free_transcriber(transcriber_handle);
     return 0;
   }

   All API calls are thread-safe, so you can call them from multiple threads
   concurrently. Calculations on a single transcriber will be serialized
   however, so latency will be affected for calls from other threads while
   the transcriber is busy.

/* All transcription calls return a list of "lines". These line objects
represent a piece of speech, something like a sentence or phrase. For
non-streaming calls, you get back a finalized list of these lines, with all
their states set to “complete”. Each streaming call returns a similar list, but
if there isn’t a pause at the end of the current audio - if the user still
seems to be speaking but cut off - the final line will be marked as being
incomplete.

All memory referenced by the line objects is owned by the transcriber and is
valid until the next call to that transcriber, or until the transcriber is
freed.

The audio data is 16KHz float PCM, between -1.0 and 1.0.

To make the streaming results easier to work with we offer some guarantees:

 - Lines are never removed from the results, only added.

 - Only the last line in the list may potentially be incomplete.

 - If speech is detected by the VAD, but no transcription can be produced, the
   line will be an empty string, "".

 - Line indexes can be used as stable references when repeatedly calling
   streaming transcription. This means a client can remember the length of the
   last results returned, and when it calls again it can figure out the updates
   by iterating the results starting at that line index.

 - The line id is a stable identifier for the line. This is set to a 64-bit
   randomly-generated number, with the goal of minimizing the chances of a
   collision. Currently these IDs are in ascending order in any one transcript,
   but this is not guaranteed and should not be relied on.

 - When speaker identification is enabled (the opt-in ``identify_speakers``
   option), each line carries an array of speaker spans describing who was
   talking during which parts of the line, including UTF-8 character ranges
   into the line text. Word timestamps are enabled automatically in this mode.
   Speaker IDs are 64-bit
   randomly-generated numbers that are stable for a given speaker within a
   stream, and speaker indices count speakers in order of first appearance.
   Unlike the text and timing of a line, speaker spans for recent audio are
   *mutable*: streaming diarization re-clusters a sliding window
   (``diarization_cluster_window_sec``, default 120s) as more speech arrives;
   assignments for older audio are frozen. The ``have_speakers_changed`` flag is
   set on a line whenever its spans changed since the previous call.

See the stream transcription examples below for more details on what this
means in practice.

   A word is judged unusual by how the model's own tokenizer spells it. That

/* Loads models from the file system, using `path` as the root directory. The
   implementation expects the following files to be present in the directory:
   - encoder_model.ort
   - decoder_model_merged.ort
   - tokenizer.bin
   The .ort files are quantized activation ONNX models that have been converted
   to ORT format using the onnxruntime tools. The simplest way to obtain these
   files is to run the `scripts/download-moonshine-model.py` script, for
   example `python scripts/download-moonshine-model.py --model-type base
   --model-language en`.
   The source weights are available on the Hugging Face Model Hub at
   https://huggingface.co/moonshine-ai/, and the download and conversion to
   ONNX script is available in this repository at
   `scripts/convert-moonshine-model.sh`.
   The tokenizer.bin contains the token to character mapping for the model,
   in a compact binary format. The `scripts/json-to-bin-vocab.py` can be used
   to convert common tokenizer.json files to tokenizer.bin files.

   The `model_arch` parameter is used to select the model architecture, for
   example MOONSHINE_MODEL_ARCH_BASE or MOONSHINE_MODEL_ARCH_TINY_STREAMING.

   The `options` parameter is used to set any custom options for the
   transcriber. Recognized options include ``log_ort_run`` (bool),
   ``ort_providers`` (comma-separated execution provider names such as
   ``CoreML,CPU`` on macOS; default and recommendation is CPU-only, and the
   iOS and Android libraries ship with no other choice — see
   docs/execution-providers.md), and ``coreml_cache_dir`` (directory for the
   CoreML compiled model cache on macOS).
   Pass ``use_speculative_decoding`` (bool, default true) to control
   speculative re-decode of the previous hypothesis on streaming updates
   (set false to fall back to greedy redecode from BOS).
   Pass ``decode_incomplete_lines`` (bool, default true) to run the
   decoder on in-progress lines so the transcript can update while someone
   is still talking. Set false to encode (and diarize) as audio arrives
   but wait until the line is complete before decoding.
   Pass ``keyterms`` (comma-separated terms, e.g.
   ``Kubernetes,Anushka Sharma,ANSI/ISO``) to bias the decoder towards words it
   would otherwise be unlikely to produce - jargon, product names, contact
   names. No retraining is involved: each term is compiled into a subword trie
   and used to nudge the decoder's logits, so the terms can be different on
   every transcriber and can be replaced mid-stream with
   ``moonshine_transcriber_set_keyterms``. Match the capitalization and
   spelling you want to see in the output. Only the streaming architectures
   apply this. Pass ``context`` instead (or as well) to hand over a passage of
   free-form text and have the terms picked out of it, as
   ``moonshine_transcriber_set_context`` does, with ``context_max_terms``
   (int, default 200) capping how many are taken.
   ``keyterm_boost`` (float, default 2.0) sets the strength. The
   default is where the terms come out most accurately; going higher recovers no
   more of them and starts putting them where they were not said, so lower it if
   general accuracy matters more than the list does, rather than raising it.
   Pass ``identify_speakers`` (bool, default false) to enable speaker
   diarization: each line then carries a ``speaker_spans`` array describing
   who spoke when, including UTF-8 character ranges into the line text.
   This also enables word timestamps automatically. This runs the cpp-annote
   diarization pipeline (a port of
   pyannote community-1) inline inside transcription calls, which adds
   significant compute, and re-clustering cost grows with session length unless
   bounded by ``diarization_cluster_window_sec``.
   ``diarization_cluster_cadence`` (float seconds, default 2.0) sets the
   minimum interval between re-clustering passes - raise it to reduce cost on
   long sessions - ``diarization_analyze_cadence`` (float seconds,
   default 0 = model default of 1.0) sets the sliding-window step between
   segmentation/embedding model runs (live ``add_audio`` / transcribe runs at
   most one window per call; Stop drains the rest; silent speaker classes skip
   embedding inference), and ``diarization_cluster_window_sec``
   (float seconds, default 120.0) limits how much audio history VBx
   re-clustering considers on each refresh (0 = unlimited full history).
   Pass ``"spelling_model_path"`` with a path to a
   spelling-CNN ``.ort`` file (e.g.
   ``https://download.moonshine.ai/model/spelling-en/spelling_cnn.ort``)
   to enable alphanumeric spelling fusion via
   ``MOONSHINE_FLAG_SPELLING_MODE``; if not set, the spelling model is
   not loaded and the flag is a no-op.

   The `options_count` parameter is the number of options in the options array.

   The `moonshine_version` parameter should be set to MOONSHINE_HEADER_VERSION
   to ensure that if a newer version of the library is loaded, it emulates the
   behavior of the older version to ensure compatibility.

   The return value is a handle to a transcriber, which can be used to identify
   the transcriber in subsequent calls. If there was an error, a negative value
   is returned. This code can be converted to a human-readable string using
   moonshine_error_to_string.

       set.

       ``adapter.ort``, ``cross_kv.ort``, ``decoder_kv.ort``,

       optional ``decoder_kv_with_attention.ort`` when ``word_timestamps`` is
       set.
     - Either kind also accepts ``spelling_cnn.ort``, and the two diarization
       models ``segmentation.ort`` and ``embedding.ort``, which are required
       when the ``identify_speakers`` option is set. Fetch those two with
       moonshine_get_diarization_dependencies.
   Unrecognized keys are rejected with MOONSHINE_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT, and
   missing required keys cause the load to fail. The recognized set is the
   union of the names above across every architecture, so passing an asset
   this architecture or option set has no use for is fine - handing over a
   whole downloaded model directory works - but a misspelled name is reported
   against the key you passed instead of surfacing later as a missing-asset
   failure.

   When ``memory[i]`` is non-NULL and ``memory_sizes[i]`` > 0, that buffer is
   used as the asset bytes. The library does not copy the model buffers (the
   ONNX Runtime sessions read them directly), so the buffers must outlive the
   transcriber, exactly as for moonshine_load_transcriber_from_memory. When
   ``memory[i]`` is NULL or ``memory_sizes[i]`` is zero, ``filenames[i]`` is
   also used as a filesystem path (relative to the current working directory
   unless absolute), so callers can mix in-memory and on-disk assets.

   All other parameters behave as in the other transcriber loaders. Returns a
   non-negative handle on success, or a negative error code on failure. */

   from a file or other static source where you have all the audio data at once.
   If you are transcribing audio from a live microphone or other real-time

   `transcriber_handle` should be a handle to a transcriber returned by

   `audio_data` should be a pointer to an array of PCM audio data, between -1.0
    and 1.0, at a sample rate of `sample_rate` Hz. Internally the library uses
    16,000 Hz, so to avoid resampling you should capture audio at this rate if
    possible.

   `audio_length` should be the number of samples in the audio data array.

   `sample_rate` should be the sample rate of the audio data, in Hz.
   `flags` should be a bitwise OR of flags. Currently the only supported flag
   is MOONSHINE_FLAG_SPELLING_MODE, which applies alphanumeric-spelling fusion

/* Streaming allows the library to incrementally return updated results as

   The `transcriber_handle` should be a handle to a transcriber returned by
   moonshine_load_transcriber_from_files or

   multiple streams associated with it, and each stream can be used to
   transcribe a separate audio stream.

   The `flags` should be a bitwise OR of flags. None are currently supported so
   this should always be zero.

   The return value is a handle to a stream, which can be used to identify the
   stream in subsequent calls. If there was an error, a negative value is
   returned. The error code can be converted to a human-readable string using
   moonshine_error_to_string.

   Below is some pseudocode showing an example of how to use streaming. In a
   real application you'll want to check the return value of the functions and
   handle errors appropriately. `get_audio_from_microphone` stands in for your
   capture loop: feed each chunk to
   moonshine_transcribe_add_audio_to_stream (safe from an audio callback),
   then call moonshine_transcribe_stream on another thread when you want an
   updated transcript. A more complete example is the streaming test in
   core/moonshine-c-api-test.cpp.

   ```c
    int32_t transcriber_handle = moonshine_load_transcriber_from_files(
        "path/to/models", MOONSHINE_MODEL_ARCH_BASE, NULL, 0,
        MOONSHINE_HEADER_VERSION);

      moonshine_transcribe_add_audio_to_stream(transcriber_handle,
        stream_handle, latest_audio_data, latest_audio_data_length,
       microphone_sample_rate, 0);

    moonshine_free_stream(transcriber_handle, stream_handle);
    moonshine_free_transcriber(transcriber_handle);
    ```

   The transcripts that are returned consist of a list of lines, each with
   text, audio data, timestamp, duration, and other metadata. This metadata
   includes an `is_updated` flag, which is set to 1 if the line has been updated
   since the last call to moonshine_transcribe_stream. You can use this as a
   "dirty flag" to determine how to update your UI in a minimal way, touching
   only the elements that have changed. Updated lines only appear at the end of
   the list of lines, and once the `is_complete` flag is set to 1 for a line,
   its text and timing will never change again.

   The one exception is speaker information: when the `identify_speakers`
   option is enabled, speaker spans for recent audio can be revised on any call
   to moonshine_transcribe_stream, since diarization re-clusters a sliding
   window of recent speech. Older assignments are frozen. Watch the
   `have_speakers_changed` flag to detect these revisions.

   files a model needs from the CDN (https://download.moonshine.ai) without
   hardcoding the file layout, then load the model from the resulting
   directory with moonshine_load_transcriber_from_files.

   ``language`` is a language code (for example ``"en"``) or English name (for
   example ``"English"``); it must not be empty.

   ``options`` / ``options_count`` accept the same option list you would pass to
   moonshine_load_transcriber_from_files, so a binding can build one set of
   options and use it both to resolve this manifest and to load the model.
   Options that do not change which files are needed are ignored; the ones that
   do are honored:
     - ``model_arch``: one of the MOONSHINE_MODEL_ARCH_* constants as a decimal
       string. When omitted, the default (first) model for the language is
       used. Note: MOONSHINE_MODEL_ARCH_BASE_STREAMING is defined but not
       currently published in the model catalog.
     - ``word_timestamps`` (bool): when true, the optional attention decoder
       (``decoder_kv_with_attention.ort`` for streaming, or
       ``decoder_with_attention.ort`` for non-streaming) is included for
       languages that publish it. This file is only needed to produce word-level
       timestamps and roughly doubles the download, so it defaults to false.
     - ``include_spelling`` / ``spelling`` (bool), or ``spelling_model_path``
       (non-empty path): when set and a spelling model is published for the
       language, its files are appended as an extra group. Defaults to false.
   Other options are ignored.

   On success, writes a NUL-terminated JSON object to
   ``*out_dependencies_json`` and returns ``MOONSHINE_ERROR_NONE``. The shape
   is:

   filename),
   ``url`` (fully-qualified download URL, i.e. ``base_url + "/" + name``),
   ``size`` (bytes, or null when unknown), ``checksum`` (base64 digest, or ""),
   and ``checksum_type`` (e.g. "crc32c", or ""). A model is a single group,
   plus an optional second group for the spelling model (which uses a different
   ``base_url``). The buffer is allocated with ``malloc``; release it with
   ``free``. On failure (empty language, unknown language, or a language that
   does not publish the requested architecture) returns a non-zero error code,

   stream from a worker thread is safe; they block each other.
